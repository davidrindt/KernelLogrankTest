This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
biofeedback <- read.csv('biofeedback_csv.csv')
require(ggplot2)
require(survival)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
mfit <- coxph(Surv(thdur, success) ~ bfb + log2heal, data=biofeedback)
mfit
```
```{r}
termplot(mfit, term=2, se=TRUE, col.term=1, col.se=1)

```


```{r}
splinefit <- coxph(Surv(thdur, success) ~ bfb + pspline(log2heal, df=3), data =biofeedback)
splinefit
```


```{r}
termplot(splinefit, term=2, se=TRUE, col.term=1, col.se=1)

```


```{r}
plot(survfit(Surv(thdur, success) ~ bfb, data = biofeedback), 
    xlab = "Days", 
    ylab = "Overall survival probability")
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
